In other words, everything is the same, except HTTPS offers an additional layer of security as it uses SSL to transfer the information.<\/p>\n<p>SSL (or Secure Sockets Layer), is the key element in all of this. It\u2019s what Google really cares about because this is how the information being sent and received is kept secure.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Google Prefers HTTPS<\/h2>\n<p>With the guaranteed security that HTTPS provides, it comes as no surprise that Google prefers HTTPS over HTTP, but what exactly does this entail for you and your website?<\/p>\n<p>Essentially, when your browser sees a secure site, it uses the information from your SSL certificate to verify the site\u2019s identity. This way, users can be confident that the website that they are viewing (and potentially even purchasing from), is safe.<\/p>\n<p>What makes HTTPS Google\u2019s preference is the fact that it uses this extra layer of security. It&#8217;s called the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol which provides the following layers of protection:<\/p>\n<div class=\"list-styles list-styles__circle list-styles__circle--primary-color\"><ul>\n<li>Encryption: this is the process of converting the information or data that is being transmitted into a code, to prevent any unauthorised access.<\/li>\n<li>Data Integrity: this prevents your data from being modified or corrupted during transmission without being detected.<\/li>\n<li>Authentication: this ensures that users are transferring information to the right website.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p>We want to stress that this SEO increase is \u201cvery lightweight\u201d, so don\u2019t expect to see your rankings shoot up after switching to HTTPS!<\/p>\n<p>That being said, let\u2019s look at how HTTPS can help improve your SEO.<\/p>\n<h2>SEO Benefits of HTTPS<\/h2>\n<p>1. Increased Google Rankings &#8211; we\u2019ll get this one out of the way as it\u2019s pretty obvious and we\u2019ve already mentioned this several times now. Shifting to HTTPS = a (subtle) increase in rankings.<\/p>\n<p>2. Improved Security &#8211; this is another obvious reason why HTTPS is great for SEO, the improved security ensures all communication is encrypted, information cannot be corrupted by third parties etc.<\/p>\n<p>3. Increased Conversions &#8211; an extension of point number two, if users feel safe on your website, they\u2019re more likely to enter their sensitive information that is required to make a purchase or sign up to a newsletter.<\/p>\n<h2>Potential Risks of HTTPS<\/h2>\n<p>Below we\u2019ve highlighted a few points to take a note of during and after the transition from HTTP to HTTPS.<\/p>\n<p>1. Redirects &#8211; When shifting over to HTTPS, you need to make sure that all variants of your website redirect to the correct HTTPS version using a 301 redirect. This is something that we have already <a href=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/?post_type=module&amp;p=1466#HtIa301R\">highlighted here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>2. Internal Linking &#8211; As with redirects, you may also need to go through the internal links on your website and ensure that they are pointing to the correct HTTPS version, this is especially important if your internal links are absolute.<\/p>\n<p>3. Sitemaps &#8211; Ensure that you create a new (or update your existing sitemap) so that only the HTTPS pages are listed. Failing to do so will mean that Google may not crawl these versions of the web page.<\/p>\n<p>4. Index Management &#8211; After you\u2019ve made the switch, ensure that no HTTP pages are still indexed by Google. These will cause unnecessary duplication and waste your crawl budget too. A quick way to check this is to use the following site search: \u201csite:yourdomain.com inurl:http:\/\/\u201d.

Don\u2019t Let Your Certificate Expire &#8211; It\u2019s all well and good that you\u2019ve made your shift, but remember to renew your SSL certificate before it expires. Otherwise, when Google sends visitors to your site in the search results, they\u2019ll get the following big full screen warning. Not the best look.<\/p>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1508\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9-warning.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"279\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9-warning.jpg 500w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9-warning-72x40.jpg 72w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9-warning-143x80.jpg 143w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9-warning-54x30.jpg 54w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9-warning-108x60.jpg 108w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9-warning-43x24.jpg 43w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9-warning-86x48.jpg 86w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9-warning-32x18.jpg 32w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9-warning-65x36.jpg 65w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/>\n<h2>How to Switch From HTTP to HTTPS<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s pretty clear that HTTPS is the way to go (despite the risks involved &#8211; which as you can see are pretty simple to solve), so let\u2019s take a look at some of Google\u2019s guidelines on switching over to HTTPS.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some <a href=\"https:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2014\/08\/https-as-ranking-signal.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">basic tips from Google:<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"list-styles list-styles__circle list-styles__circle--primary-color\"><ul>\n<li>Decide the kind of certificate you need: single (only covers one domain), multi-domain (covers multiple domains) , or wildcard certificate (covers one domain, and it\u2019s sub-domains).<\/li>\n<li>Use 2048-bit key certificates.<\/li>\n<li>Use relative URLs for resources that reside on the same secure domain.<\/li>\n<li>Use protocol relative URLs for all other domains.<\/li>\n<li>Check out our Site move article for more guidelines on how to change your website\u2019s address.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t block your HTTPS site from crawling using robots.txt.<\/li>\n<li>Allow indexing of your pages by search engines where possible.
