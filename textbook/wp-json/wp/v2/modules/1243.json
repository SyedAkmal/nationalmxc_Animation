users will spend more time on your website, which could lead to an increase in conversions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #89b504;\">Better Experience &#8211; through the use of headings, long form content is easily navigable for the user to find what they\u2019re looking for.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Expensive and time consuming &#8211; writing a well researched long form article takes time and demands a thorough understanding of the topic.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Less Mobile-Friendly &#8211; results in lots of scrolling for mobile users who are likely looking for quick answers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Inconsistency &#8211;

due to lack of detail, short form content may be considered as \u201clower\u201d in quality<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Poor User Engagement &#8211; users will spend less time on your website if they see that their query isn\u2019t being answered<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Not Always Search Friendly &#8211; if your content is too short, you are less likely to rank for the keywords you want to target<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p>When it comes to long form and short form content, we can see that there\u2019s no clear winner.<\/p>\n<p>The main point to consider therefore, is the user\u2019s search intent.<\/p>\n<p>Afterall, RankBrain (Google\u2019s machine learning algorithm and the 3rd most important ranking factor) aims to provide the user with the most relevant results for their query.<\/p>\n<h2>Content Formats<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at how user intent and content length affect different types of content.<\/p>\n<h4>Articles<\/h4>\n<p>Purpose: found on news or magazine style websites to cover trending topics<br \/>\nContent Length: Short Form<br \/>\nIntent: Informational<\/p>\n<h4>Blog Posts<\/h4>\n<p>Purpose: posts that cover related topics within a site\u2019s niche by targeting long tail keywords to attract more visitors.<br \/>\nContent Length: Short Form<br \/>\nIntent: Informational<\/p>\n<h4>Guides<\/h4>\n<p>Purpose: instructional articles that go into detail about \u201chow to\u201d perform a task.<br \/>\nContent Length: Long Form<br \/>\nIntent: Informational<\/p>\n<h4>Infographics<\/h4>\n<p>Purpose: commonly used to condense long form content into more engaging material that is easier to share<br \/>\nContent Length: Short Form<br \/>\nIntent: Mixed (Informational \/ Navigational)<\/p>\n<h4>Lists<\/h4>\n<p>Purpose: a type of article that is presented as a list to make it easier to follow. Commonly used for recipes and reviews.<br \/>\nContent Length: Long Form<br \/>\nIntent: Mixed (Commercial \/ Informational)<\/p>\n<h4>Maps<\/h4>\n<p>Purpose: using Google Maps functionality to make your business easier to find.<br \/>\nContent Length: Short Form<br \/>\nIntent: Navigational<\/p>\n<h4>Product Pages<\/h4>\n<p>Purpose: commonly found on eCommerce websites including detailed descriptions about a product<br \/>\nContent Length: Long Form<br \/>\nIntent: Transactional<\/p>\n<h4>Videos<\/h4>\n<p>Purpose: commonly used to condense long form content into more engaging material such as video tutorials.<br \/>\nContent Length: Short Form<br \/>\nIntent: Mixed (Informational \/ Navigational)<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"WMGC\">What Makes Good Content?<\/h2>\n<h3>Know What Your Users Want and Give it To Them<\/h3>\n<p>This is perhaps the most important factor after the obvious \u201cwrite quality content\u201d. If the content on your web page isn\u2019t useful to the user, it\u2019s likelihood of ranking is very low. We\u2019ve already looked at how we can use the power of keyword grouping to find relevant queries that users are looking for in the Keyword Research module. But now, it\u2019s about actually using those words within your content.<\/p>\n<h4>Understanding Search Behaviour<\/h4>\n<p>Remember, different users have different experiences. Users who are new to a topic will likely search for generic terms like \u201chow to rank in google\u201d, but more experienced or informed users may search for specific terms like \u201cseo ranking factors\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>By anticipating search behaviour and accounting for different types of users\u2019 queries when creating your content by including a good mix of keyword phrases, you\u2019re increasing your Google\u2019s understanding of the page and that you are meeting the needs of a wider audience.<\/p>\n<h3>Content That People Want to Share<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s all well and good identifying the target audience for your piece of content, but you should also think about the people that run websites within your industry or niche who can link to you.<\/p>\n<p>These are the guys who\u2019re the most likely to share your brilliant piece of content &#8211; so impressing them is key.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s see how we can make it easier to entice your audience (and maybe even your competitors) to share your content.<\/p>\n<h4>Share Triggers<\/h4>\n<p>A <strong>share trigger<\/strong> is a psychological element within your content that encourages users to share your content.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s go over a few:<\/p>\n<p>1. <strong>Utility<\/strong> &#8211; content utility is about offering your audience practical advice or information. A perfect example of high utility content are recipes.<\/p>\n<p>2. <strong>Content Length<\/strong> &#8211; we\u2019ve already touched on this, but the length of your content determines its likelihood of it being shared. For example, Buzzmo found that longer content is more likely to be shared because it creates a sense of \u201cawe\u201d.<\/p>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1247\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-Avg-shares-by-content-length.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"644\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-Avg-shares-by-content-length.png 644w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-Avg-shares-by-content-length-56x40.png 56w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-Avg-shares-by-content-length-111x80.png 111w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-Avg-shares-by-content-length-42x30.png 42w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-Avg-shares-by-content-length-83x60.png 83w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-Avg-shares-by-content-length-33x24.png 33w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-Avg-shares-by-content-length-67x48.png 67w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-Avg-shares-by-content-length-25x18.png 25w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-Avg-shares-by-content-length-50x36.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px\" \/>\n<p>3. <strong>Memorability<\/strong> &#8211; memorable ideas and concepts that grab the user\u2019s attention are more likely to inspire shares.<\/p>\n<p>4. <strong>Positivity<\/strong> &#8211; people are more inclined to share positivity, so wherever possible write content that elicits a positive tone.<\/p>\n<p>5. <strong>Storytelling<\/strong> &#8211; people love a great story &#8211; whether you\u2019re writing about a product, a service or even creating a video tutorials &#8211; a strong narrative will connect more with your audience<\/p>\n<h3>Content That&#8217;s Fresh<\/h3>\n<p>As a follow up to its Caffeine update, Google rolled out its Freshness or \u201cfresh results\u201d algorithm in 2011 which impacted close to 35% of the search results. Why? Because Google\u2019s primary goal is to provide the most relevant and useful information to the user. The algorithm is \u201cdesigned to give you the most up-to-date results\u201d so that if you search for \u201ccricket scores\u201d, you\u2019ll get the most recent results\/scores.<\/p>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1248\" src=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-cricket-scores.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1047\" height=\"918\" srcset=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-cricket-scores.jpg 1047w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-cricket-scores-46x40.jpg 46w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-cricket-scores-91x80.jpg 91w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-cricket-scores-34x30.jpg 34w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-cricket-scores-68x60.jpg 68w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-cricket-scores-27x24.jpg 27w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-cricket-scores-55x48.jpg 55w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-cricket-scores-21x18.jpg 21w, https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7-cricket-scores-41x36.jpg 41w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1047px) 100vw, 1047px\" \/>\n<h4>Query Deserves Freshness<\/h4>\n<p>Google is constantly analysing small portions of the web and is constantly updating its search index as it finds undiscovered content. So, when a search query suddenly increases in popularity, Google uses Query Deserves Freshness to quickly find fresh content on that particular topic and gives it precedence in the search results.<\/p>\n<h4>Ways to Tackle Content Freshness<\/h4>\n<p>1. <strong>Create Evergreen Content<\/strong> &#8211; content that will stay relevant for a long period of time.<\/p>\n<p>2. <strong>Updating Existing Content<\/strong> &#8211; pages that were published one year ago may not be as relevant, for example the \u201cbest xbox games\u201d will change year from year, so your article should reflect these changes too.<\/p>\n<p>3. <strong>Social Sharing<\/strong> &#8211; sharing content on your social media (which triggers more shares) will add to Google\u2019s QDF and Freshness algorithms.<\/p>\n<p>4. <strong>Content Frequency<\/strong> &#8211; publishing content (whether it\u2019s an article, blog post or even a video) on a regular basis will naturally add to Google\u2019s Freshness algorithm.<\/p>\n<h3>Content That Inspires Trust<\/h3>\n<p>Users want to feel comfortable when visiting your website &#8211; they want to trust that your content will answer their query.<\/p>\n<p>In order to do this, it\u2019s important to ensure that you build a strong reputation with your content.<\/p>\n<p>For example, eCommerce websites should have clear and satisfying customer service information that helps resolves any problems that a customer may have.<\/p>\n<p>News articles should clearly indicate who is responsible for the content as well as properly cite any sources that were used. Adding expert opinions and sources to technical articles shows users that the article is well researched and is likely to be more trustworthy.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll dive into much more detail as to how you can improve your site\u2019s authority and trustworthiness later on in the module.<\/p>\n"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/1243"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/module"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/1243\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1397,"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/1243\/revisions\/1397"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/modules\/406"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1243"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
