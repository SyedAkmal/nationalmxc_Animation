If you\u2019re able to rank your local business at the top of these searches, you\u2019re ensuring that people will be walking through your door and getting in touch with you straight after.<\/p>\n<h2>Components of Local SEO<\/h2>\n<p>Local SEO isn\u2019t all too different from general SEO optimisation.<\/p>\n<p>In this section, we\u2019ll briefly explain how to approach keyword research, content, link building and technical SEO with a local focus.<\/p>\n<h3>Keyword Research<\/h3>\n<p>Approaching keyword research for local SEO is largely the same, with a few tweaks here and there.<\/p>\n<p>More and more people are making voice searches on their mobile devices or via products like Amazon Echo, and Google Home. For example, it\u2019s much easier to say \u201cfind a coffee shop near me\u201d than to type it.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s therefore important to consider variations of keywords that have a more conversational tone or focus, especially if you are a local brick-and-mortar, service-oriented business like a restaurant or lawyer.<\/p>\n<p>We will show you how you can adapt our <a href=\"https:\/\/susodigital.com\/textbook\/module\/semantic-search-method\/ontological-keyword-research\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ontological Keyword Research<\/a> process for local websites later on in this module.<\/p>\n<h3>Content<\/h3>\n<p>It goes without saying that content that has a local focus will significantly increase your chances of ranking for local queries.<\/p>\n<p>As with any content, it\u2019s always about understanding what the search intent and purpose for the query you want to target is &#8211; simply stuffing your pages with lots of targeted content will not be effective.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll go into much more detail on how to optimise your content for Local SEO later on in the module &#8211; the key thing to note here, is to aim to write custom local content with the end user in mind.<\/p>\n<h3>Link Building<\/h3>\n<p>Although the general forms of link building do apply to Local SEO, there are a few specific differences that cater purely to local campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>A quality local link profile should have links from the following categories:<\/p>\n<div class=\"list-styles list-styles__circle list-styles__circle--primary-color\"><ul>\n<li><u>Citations<\/u> &#8211; these are websites where you submit your business details (name, address, phone number, website), in order to increase its local search presence.<\/li>\n<li><u>Local Directories<\/u> &#8211; adding your business\u2019s website to local directories will help increase your link authority for local search queries.<\/li>\n<li><u>Industry-related Local sites<\/u> &#8211; securing links from local businesses, schools, newspapers etc will further increase your profile significantly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Technical SEO<\/h3>\n<p>As with every component we\u2019ve mentioned so far, the majority of the technical aspects of a local website are the same for any other site.<\/p>\n<p>However, there are a few aspects of technical SEO that you can optimise to specifically enhance your local SEO.<\/p>\n<div class=\"list-styles list-styles__circle list-styles__circle--primary-color\"><ul>\n<li>Schema Markup &#8211; there are several schema markups that Google have specifically created for Local SEO. We\u2019ll go into more detail on how you can do this later on in the module.<\/li>\n<li>Mobile Optimisation &#8211; with the majority of localised searches made on mobile devices, it\u2019s more important than ever before that your website is mobile friendly.
