This is because Google wants to provide users with a safe and secure experience.<\/li>\n<li>Country-code TLD &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/182192?hl=en\">Google confirmed<\/a> that ccTLDs like .co.uk and .es \u201c<em>are a strong signal to both users and search engines that your site is explicitly intended for a certain country<\/em>\u201d but this may decrease your chances of ranking globally.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Page and Content Level<\/h2>\n<p>Content is king. If your web pages are lacking in great content, they will simply struggle to rank. In fact, Google has an entire 168-page document called the <a href=\"https:\/\/static.googleusercontent.com\/media\/guidelines.raterhub.com\/en\/\/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\">Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines<\/a> detailing what it considers to be high-quality content.<\/p>\n<p>The most important page and content level ranking signals are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimised Meta Tags<\/strong> &#8211; although not quite as important as it used to be, you should still include your primary keyword within <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seroundtable.com\/google-keywords-in-urls-a-small-ranking-factor-21577.html\">your URL<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4FkSZIW6d48#t=980\">page title<\/a>, H1 heading (and other headings) and meta description. It is worth noting that Google has confirmed <a href=\"https:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2009\/09\/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html\">that meta descriptions are no longer a ranking signal<\/a>, however they are used by Google to display snippets in the search results.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Topical Relevance<\/strong> &#8211; Google looks at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=muSIzHurn4U\">over 200 signals<\/a> to ensure that the most relevant web pages are being displayed to users. Therefore, the topical relevance of the content on the web page is crucial.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Search Intent<\/strong> &#8211; Addressing the search intent behind the user\u2019s query is another cornerstone of content optimisation. In fact, there are 400 mentions of \u201cintent\u201d in <a href=\"https:\/\/static.googleusercontent.com\/media\/guidelines.raterhub.com\/en\/\/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\">Google\u2019s Search Quality Rater Guidelines<\/a>, which emphasises its importance. It\u2019s for this reason that we have also dedicated an entire module to Search Intent.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Unique Content<\/strong> &#8211; Having very similar or duplicate content on the same site <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/66359?hl=en\">can negatively impact<\/a> your website\u2019s ability to rank. Ensure that each page contains unique content that addresses the user\u2019s search intent.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Content Freshness<\/strong> &#8211; Although the frequency of content updates is not a ranking signal, ensuring that your content is up to date (for <a href=\"https:\/\/static.googleusercontent.com\/media\/guidelines.raterhub.com\/en\/\/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\">particular search queries which demand \u201cfresh\u201d content<\/a>) is an important signal.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Content Length<\/strong> &#8211; Although <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bigseo\/comments\/clg1hn\/how_to_find_word_count_in_serp\/\">John Mueller has confirmed<\/a> that \u201cword count is not a ranking factor\u201d, it\u2019s important to consider the user\u2019s search intent to determine how long the content on a web page should be. It\u2019s all about finding the right balance; we will explore content length in greater detail later on in the textbook.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Content Depth and Accuracy<\/strong> &#8211; One of the most important signals when it comes to content is content depth. In its <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/7451184?visit_id=637051210288825901-4028737426&amp;hl=en&amp;rd=3\">SEO starter guide<\/a>, Google says \u201c<em>Creating high quality content takes a significant amount of at least one of the following: time, effort, expertise, and talent\/skill. Content should be factually accurate, clearly written, and comprehensive<\/em>\u201d.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Technical Implementation<\/h2>\n<p>Some of the most important ranking signals for the technical implementations of your website are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Internal Linking<\/strong> &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oCNi7dTircw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2882\">John Mueller emphasised<\/a> that the \u201c<em>context we [Google] pick up from internal linking is really important to us<\/em>\u201d.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Site Architecture<\/strong> &#8211; John Mueller highlighted the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fCMwhn8cZD4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2361\">importance of site architecture<\/a> recommending webmasters to \u201c<em>avoid setting up a situation where normal website navigation doesn&#8217;t work. So we should be able to crawl from one URL to any other URL on your website just by following the links on the page<\/em>&#8220;. This largely pertains to making it easier for Google to discover and crawl your website. After all, if Google is unable to crawl your website, then it will also be unable to index and rank it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Structured Data<\/strong> &#8211; Structured data is another factor that isn\u2019t necessarily a direct ranking signal, but instead helps the crawlability and indexability of your web content. It\u2019s a way of <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JohnMu\/status\/980902538865205248\">providing more contextual information<\/a> about your website\u2019s content to Google.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Usability<\/h2>\n<p>As mentioned in it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/intl\/en_uk\/search\/howsearchworks\/algorithms\/\">How Search Works article<\/a>, Google \u201calso evaluates whether webpages are easy to use\u201d when ranking its results.<\/p>\n<p>Algorithms are employed to determine how usable a website and web page is based on factors like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Browser Compatibility<\/strong> &#8211; Google <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/100782\">looks at<\/a> \u201cwhether the site appears correctly in different browsers\u201d.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Page\/Site Speed<\/strong> &#8211; Introduced in 2010, site and page speed is another ranking factor that Google has <a href=\"https:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2010\/04\/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html\">explicitly confirmed<\/a> as influencing the SERPs. A fast loading web page has a higher chance of ranking in the top positions as it provides better user experience, increases engagement and improves conversion rates.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mobile Usability<\/strong> &#8211; Now that mobile search has eclipsed desktop, Google have fully shifted to a mobile-first index. This means that ensuring that the mobile version of your website performs well has never been more important. Mobile usability is so important, that Google has created their own <a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/test\/mobile-friendly\">Mobile-Friendly Test Tool<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Link Based Factors<\/h2>\n<p>Backlinks form the basis of Google\u2019s PageRank algorithm and are arguably one of the most important ranking signals that Google uses to determine a website\u2019s ranking ability.<\/p>\n<p>There are lots of factors that contribute to Google\u2019s evaluation of backlinks (we have listed some of these in the Web Spam factors section below), but the two most important ones are relevance and authority.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2019\/03\/this-year-in-search-spam-webspam-report.html\">Google states<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote d-flex align-items-center bg-suso-white text-dark-blue line-height-1-5\"><svg class=\"blockquote__icon d-block\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 34 29\" viewBox=\"0 0 34 29\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\"><g fill=\"#18217e\" opacity=\".5\"><path d=\"m10.6 13.1c-.8-.2-1.6-.4-2.4-.4-1.2 0-2.2.3-3 .7.8-2.9 2.6-8 6.2-8.5.3-.1.6-.4.6-.7l.8-3c.1-.3 0-.5-.1-.7s-.4-.4-.6-.4c-.2-.1-.5-.1-.8-.1-4.4 0-8.7 4.8-10.5 11.6-1.1 4-1.4 10.1 1.3 13.9 1.5 2.1 3.6 3.3 6.4 3.4 3.4 0 6.5-2.4 7.4-5.9.6-2.1.3-4.2-.7-6.1s-2.7-3.2-4.6-3.8z\"\/><path d=\"m33 16.9c-1-1.9-2.6-3.2-4.6-3.8-.8-.2-1.6-.4-2.4-.4-1.2 0-2.2.3-3 .7.8-2.9 2.6-8 6.2-8.5.3-.1.6-.3.7-.7l.8-3c.1-.3 0-.5-.1-.7s-.4-.4-.6-.4c-.3-.1-.6-.1-.8-.1-4.4 0-8.7 4.8-10.5 11.6-1.1 4-1.4 10.1 1.3 13.9 1.5 2.1 3.6 3.3 6.4 3.4 3.4 0 6.5-2.4 7.4-5.9.5-2.1.2-4.2-.8-6.1z\"\/><\/g><\/svg><div><div class=\"entry-content\">\u201cWe continued to protect the value of authoritative and relevant links as an important ranking signal for search\u201d<\/div><cite class=\"opacity-0-5\">Google<\/cite><\/div><\/blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relevance<\/strong> &#8211; A backlink from a domain and\/or page that is highly relevant to your website or web page is considerably more valuable than one coming from an irrelevant website. <a href=\"https:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2019\/03\/this-year-in-search-spam-webspam-report.html\">Google states<\/a> that &#8220;<em>relevant, quality inbound links can affect your PageRank<\/em>\u201d.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Authority<\/strong> &#8211; A backlink from a highly authoritative domain and\/or page to your website or web page is considerably more valuable than one that has little to no authority itself.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Web Spam Factors<\/h2>\n<p>Considering how influential links are to a website\u2019s search rankings, it comes as no surprise that Google has certain measures in place to both detect and prevent web spam.<\/p>\n<p>Below we have outlined some of the link based factors that may be manipulated and be considered as web spam by Google.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The number of links<\/strong> &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/infolab.stanford.edu\/~backrub\/google.html\">Google claims<\/a> that \u201c<em>counting citations or backlinks to a given page\u2026 gives some approximation of a page&#8217;s importance or quality<\/em>\u201d.
